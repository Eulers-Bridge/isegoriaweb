# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

                             <p>Each and every Isegoria user can expect their data to be secured using industry practice technologies for their confidentiality and privacy. We work to the best of our abilities to ensure full respect is paid to these important principles and to ensure that users’ expectations are met. Please review the below, in addition to our Privacy Policy which deals with this in further detail.</p>\
                             <p>This statement of security practices is a living document and may evolve in line with progressive technology, security, institutional advancements and legal change.</p>\
                             <p>1. App Security : 1.1 Isegoria uses 256-bit AES and 1024-bit SSL certificates for internet and application security. We monitor the security community's output closely and work promptly to upgrade the service to respond to new vulnerabilities as they are discovered. As a team we work to ensure we follow best practice and strive to operate at the cutting edge of all aspects of privacy and technology which apply to your use of our services.1.2 We contract with respected, external security firms to audit Isegoria and ensure our practices perform adequately and to monitor our position in light of technical advancements.1.3 Our servers are provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and located in Sydney, Australia. They are physically secured by AWS.1.4 The greatest security risk to any system is usually the behaviour of its users. In order to provide you with greater control over your account, we log account activity and can make this record available (privately – see our Privacy Policy) to you on request in writing.</p>\
                             <p>1. Confidentiality : 2.1 We place strict controls over our team’s access to internal data and are committed to ensuring that your data is never seen by anyone who should not see it.2.2 The number of our technical employees with sufficient system permissions to enable them to access and control software that stores and secures your data is kept purposefully small so as to limit the chances of unwanted and improper access. These employees will only view customer data when it is necessary to do so according to the Privacy Policy and applicable legal provisions or permissions.2.3 All of our employees and contractors are bound to our policies regarding customer data and we treat these issues as matters of the highest importance.</p>\
                             <p>Notes : If you are using Isegoria in a workplace, place of study, or on a device or account issued to you through your employment, studentship, or other relationship with an institution, you will invariably be bound by other policies regarding use and storage, access, modification, deletion and retention of communications and content. Please check with any relevant body or administrator about what policies they have in place in this regard.If you have additional questions regarding data privacy, security or confidentiality, we’d be happy to answer them.
